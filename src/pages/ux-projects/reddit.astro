    <h2 class="project-subtitle">The Problem We Found</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      We’re all familiar with Reddit: endless threads, niche communities, and
      that strange comfort of finding people who *get it*. But here’s the thing:
      as we scrolled through our feeds day after day, my team and I kept bumping
      into the same friction. Confusing icons. Unclear flows. Features that felt
      like they belonged to another app entirely. Reddit is one of the largest
      and most active platforms in the world, but why did it sometimes feel like
      we don't even get the basic knowledge of using it?
    </p>
    <h2 class="project-subtitle">The Goal</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
      We decided to find out. Over the course of this project, we ran a full
      usability study: heuristic evaluation, competitive analysis, and live user
      interviews. Our goal was simple: understand what’s actually broken, who it
      affects, and where the biggest opportunities for improvement lie.

          class="process-item-odd w-full items-center justify-center"
          id="heuristic-evaluation"
        >
          <div class="flex lg:flex-row flex-col gap-4">
            <div class="justify-between flex flex-col">
              <div>
                <h3>1. Heuristic evaluation</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Referring to Nielsen&apos;s 10 usability heuristics, we were
                  spotting UX problems before users ever do. Screen by screen,
                  flow by flow, we combed through the Reddit app. What we found
                  surprised us: <strong>27 usability issues</strong>, each rated
                  on Jakob Nielsen&apos;s severity scale. Five areas stood out
                  as the most impactful:
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Consistency and standards</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Aesthetics</strong></li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Flexibility and efficiency of use</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>User control and freedom</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Help and documentation</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <br />

                  After collecting all the information, we found that many
                  usability issues violated multiple heuristics. While some may
                  appear to be low severity, certain features were unnecessarily
                  complex, which could unintentionally overwhelm users over
                  time.

          <h3>2. Competitive analysis</h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            By comparing Reddit to other popular platforms with similar
            features, we identified both unique features Reddit offers and
            potential additions it could adopt. Our analysis included three
            direct competitors: <strong
              >Quora, Stack Exchange, and X (Twitter)</strong
            >, and three indirect ones: <strong
              >Discord, Tumblr, and TikTok</strong
            >. The question: What does Reddit do well that others don&apos;t?
            And where are others doing it better?
            <br />
            <br />
            The verdict? Reddit remains a powerhouse for community-driven content,
            <strong>serving a wildly diverse range of interests</strong>. But
            its UI and flows lag behind. Navigation feels heavier. Key actions
            take more effort. And there&apos;s
            <strong>clear room to grow</strong>, especially in how users manage
            content and stay engaged without feeling overwhelmed.

              <br />
              <h4 class="font-bold text-xl">3.1 Screener</h4>
              <p>
                Before we could test, we had to decide who to test with. With
                limited time and resources, we narrowed down to <strong
                  >18–35 year olds</strong
                >, Reddit&apos;s core demographic. But we didn&apos;t want just
                one type of user. We split participants into two groups: <strong
                  >people who&apos;d used Reddit for at least 6 months</strong
                >, and <strong
                  >people who&apos;d never used it but knew what it was</strong
                >. Because power users and newcomers experience the app
                completely differently. Watching both navigate the same tasks
                gave us a clearer picture of where the real friction lives.

                6 tasks. 5 participants. 45 minutes each. I took on the role of <strong
                  >note taker</strong
                > and <strong>observer</strong>, while my teammate facilitated.
                We recorded the session and took notes to capture the
                participants' thoughts and behaviors. After each run, we
                debriefed, comparing what we saw and what surprised us. At the
                end, participants completed the SUS (System Usability Scale)
                questionnaire so we could quantify what we&apos;d observed
                qualitatively. The numbers and the stories together told the
                full picture.

            <h3>4. Final Report</h3>
            <p>
              When I ran the numbers, the average SUS score came out to
              <strong>74</strong>, not terrible but not great either.
              <br />
              <br />
              The tests told us what we suspected: the app works, but it doesn&apos;t
              shine.The real story came from the sessions. Yes, most participants
              finished the tasks, eventually. But the journey was bumpy. Small hiccups
              piled up, mainly in 4 areas:
            </p>

            <br />
            <div class="flex flex-col gap-8">

                  ><h3>1. Browsing works, creating doesn&apos;t</h3>
                  <p>
                    Everyone could find content, whether via Google or in-app
                    search. But Reddit-specific actions, such as awarding badges,
                    creating communities, tripped people up. More than once we
                    heard the same sentiment: <em
                      >&quot;This feels like it&apos;s for more skilled
                      users.&quot;</em

                    Search feels heavier than on other platforms. Content floods
                    in without enough structure. Participants found themselves
                    clicking through more screens than they expected just to
                    land on the right thread. And the endless scroll of
                    community topics? More noise than signal.

                    &quot;upvote&quot; or &quot;awards&quot; mean to a newcomer?
                    Reddit has its own language that not a lot of people understand.
                    Users resorted to trial and error instead of feeling guided.

                1. Our assumptions will surprise us.
              </h4>
              <p>
                I went in expecting certain tasks to be nightmares. But some
                users were able to learn it much faster than we thought; others
                don't even face that issue. Research reminds you that
                you&apos;re not the user; watching real people is the only way
                to know.

                2. Pilot testing is non-negotiable.
              </h4>
              <p>
                We ran pilots before the real sessions. And many small things
                went wrong. A prompt that confused people. A flow that broke the
                rhythm. Every pilot surfaced something we&apos;d have missed. It
                would have cost us sessions and trust if we&apos;d skipped it.

                3. 5 participants reveal A LOT. More would be better.
              </h4>
              <p>
                With just 5 people, we uncovered plenty isseus, including unexpected
                bugs and behaviors we hadn&apos;t anticipated. But research is
                never &quot;done.&quot; More participants would have given us
                stronger patterns and confidence. For this project, 5 was
                enough to act on, but for production, we should aim for more.
