      Bloom Co. Tea is a UX-driven concept that reinvents the tea-buying
      experience by blending botanical storytelling with digital interaction.
      The brand invites Gen-Z customers to explore the origins, flavors, and
      rituals of artisanal teas through a visually rich interface and
      personalized recommendations. We aim to transform tea from a commodity for
      older generation into a curated ritual—creating delight for Gen-Z
      customers through elegant UX and meaningful content.

      My first game engine designed and developed by myself from the scratch
      throughout the whole semester. This game engine is based on SFML as the
      graphic interface, and 0MQ to support the server-client connection. The
      Game engine includes all the basic funtionalities including Component
      based GameObjects, Multiplayer ablities, mutli-threaded processing,
      EventSytsem, Double Timeline supports and Duktape/Dukglue Scripting
      abilities. I have used this Game Engine to developed two games, one is a
      2D platformer and the second one is the Space Invader.

    <p>
      Circulation is an interactive virtual environment that allows an
      individual to accentuates our emotional connections with nature and
      visualize the reactions to our presence. I developed this project in a
      team with students from the Art and Design department at NC State
      University. We learn and used Unity and C# to script our interactive
      environment and used Maya to model and animate the animals in the
      environment. We also earned the honor to make to the annual game showcase
      at NC State University.

    <p>
      Paint War is a game that allows two players to catch and bounce paintballs
      to each other, and if the ball splashed on the edge of the screen with
      enough amount, the other side wins. This is a team project with Master
      students from the Art and Design Department, and this is my first game
      developed using Unity Engine. We learned and used particle system built
      inside the engine and developed the mechanics using scripts.

    <p>
      This is a machinima Project using Unity Engine. I worked this project with
      another student in the Art and Design Design department. Based on the true
      story of the infamous Zodiac Killer, we developed a imaginary scene that
      as a reporter(first-person-view), you accidentally ran into a suspicious
      house that might related to the zodiac killer. As you explored the house,
      you starts to discover the strangeness of the house.
